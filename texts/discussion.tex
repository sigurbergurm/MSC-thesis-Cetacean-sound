\chapter{Discussion}

The preamplifier filter circuit therefor satisfies the manufacturer of the Aquarian H1A hydrophone recommends for cetacean monitoring.
Both for the gain required, as well as filtering signals that are not within the bandwidth of the hydrophones sensing abilities.

\textbf{Fyrir noise m√¶lingar For these measurements no special shielding was used, the ground of the probe could act as an antenna as well as there are some dangling wires.
These could all attribute to some extrinsic noise generation.}
