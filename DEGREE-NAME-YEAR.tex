%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TeXStudio Magic Comments %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% These comments that start with "!TeX" modify the way TeXStudio works
%% For details see http://texstudio.sourceforge.neit/manual/current/usermanual_en.html   Section 4.10
%%
%% What encoding is the file in?
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8
%% What language should it be spellchecked?
% !TeX spellcheck = en_US
%% What program should I compile this document with?
% !TeX program = xelatex

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Bibliography options %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% We suggest switching from bibtex to biblatex/biber because it is better able
%% to deal with Icelandic characters and other bibliography issues
%% As long as you use biblatex instead of bibtex by itself, it will at least
%%  generate a document without errors.
%% !!!If you are using TeXStudio, don't forget to update the bibliography setting!!!
\usepackage[backend=biber,bibencoding=utf8,style=ieee]{biblatex}
%\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}  
% need to declare mapping for style=apa to alphabetize properly
% If you set backend=bibtex, it will use bibtex for processing (old way)
%    this can work with Icelandic characters, but you may get weird results.
%    bibtex does not know how to sort Þ and ð
% if you set backend=biber, you can use UTF8 characters such as Þ and
%     ð  but you will have to remember to switch from using bibtex to 
%     biber in your client
% If you use JabRef, make sure the file is encoded in UTF-8 which is
%    not the default.

%% This tells TeXStudio to use biber
% !TeX TXS-program:bibliography = txs:///biber
%% This also sets the bibliography program for TeXShop and TeXWorks
% !BIB program = biber

% Where is your reference library?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CUSTOMIZATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% It is not recommended that you customize this file nor
%% ruthesis.cls.  Just fill in the necessary fields.  You should put

\newML{AbstractText}{

With ever increasing pressure on wildlife caused by humans, it becomes ever so more important to monitor the changes that might occur in the behavior and habitats of affected animals.
As well as identifying the factors that causes disturbances to the animal, to minimize or eliminate them.
Therefore creating new or improving old methods for researching and monitoring the impacts on the animals, which is crucial for the preservation of wildlife.
This thesis is a part of a larger project that proposes the design of a self-powering buoy with vocalization recording capabilities and can transfer that data onshore to researchers and will focus specifically focus on the vocalization recording aspect.
The proposed recording device consists of the Teensy 3.5, Aquarian H1a hydrophone which can record vocalization signals up to 100kHz.
The device has a low power consumption of 0.415W and a low cost of 190\$.
The device uses a programmable delay block to trigger the built-in analog to digital converter to take measurements and direct memory access is used to transfer the converted digital value to a buffer which later writes the data onto a SD card.
Currently, the device can sample signals at 16 bits resolution can record up to 300ksps which should allow it to record signals up to 150kHz.

Með auknum áhrifum mannfólks á vilt dýr, þá verður eykst mikilvægi þess að fylgjast breytingum í hegðun og búsvæðum dýrana.
Einnig þarf þá að reyna að finna þá áhrifavalda sem trufla dýrin, til að annaðhvort minnka áhrifa þessa eða eyða þeim algjörglega.
Þess vegna er mikilvægt að búa til eða bæta gamlar aðferðir til að fylgjast með og rannsaka þau áhrif sem mannfólk hefur á dýrin, í þágu varðveislu dýra.
Þessi ritgerð fjallar um mismunandi möguleika á óvirku hljóðvistareftirliti fyrir rannsóknir á hvölum.
Þessi ritgerð er hluti af stærra verkefni þar sem tillagan er að nota sjóbauja sem getur framleitt rafmagn fyrir orkulítlum raftækjum sérhannaðar í hvalahljóðs upptöku og getur síðan send þau gögn á land, en ritgerðin mun fjalla sérstaklega um hljóðupptöku þátt sjóbaujunar.
Tillagan af því tæki er að nota Teensy 3.5, og Aquarian H1a vatns hljóðnema sem getur tekið upp hljóðmerki upp að 100kHz.
Tækið notar lítið rafmagn eða um 0.415W og kostar lítið eða 190\$.
Tækið notar forritanlega bið blokk til þessa að kveikja á hljóðrænum-stafrænum umbreyti til að taka mæligildi og notar síðan beinan minnisaðgang til þess að geyma þau gildi í biðminni sem seinna skrifar gögnin á SD kort.
Eins og er getur tækið tekið upp merki með 16bita upplausn á 300ksps, sem gerir því fræðilega kleyft að taka upp merki allt að 150kHz.
Þessi ritgerð mun sýna fram á að tækið sem lagt er til er hægt að nota í að hjálpa hvala rannsökurum við rannsóknir og getur hjálpað í þágu náttúrverndar.
